# IEEE 754 Double Precision Floating Point Visualization

It's an interactive visualization of how double precision floating point representation works.

As presented during my [Everything you never wanted to know about JavaScript numbers](2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/bartek-szopka-everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-numbers-and-you-didnt-know-you-could-ask.html) talk at JSConf EU 2013.

## Disclaimer

The code is not perfect nor pretty ;)

I was playing around with different concepts to get the idea ready for JSConf. I hope to clean it up soon.
